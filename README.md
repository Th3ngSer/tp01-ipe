## About TP01 IPR
Introduction to Programming Enviroment is a subject that helps students to build a professional enviroment for coding and understanding some technical words used in everyday project development .
We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. IPE takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many projects, such as: 
- code sharing for group project development
- code version for keeping changes under control
- code ownership by identifying who make any part of the code
- task management for dividing tasks for each team member.
